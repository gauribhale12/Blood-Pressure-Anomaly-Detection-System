# Blood-Pressure-Anomaly-Detection-System

The project involved development of a Java Swing application designed for the efficient management of patient data within a comprehensive healthcare system. This system encompasses various elements, including Patients, Encounters (representing doctor visits), and Vital Signs, organized within a structured hierarchy that includes directories, communities, and cities.

The primary goal of the project was to implement a feature capable of identifying individuals with abnormal blood pressure within distinct age groups, covering at least two separate communities. The application provides users with the ability to execute Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on patient data, ensuring the robust management of healthcare records using DB4O database.

An achievement of the project is its user-friendly interface, delivering a seamless interaction for users. Moreover, the application incorporates rigorous data validation mechanisms, including checks for non-null values and basic data type validations, to maintain the integrity of the stored data.
